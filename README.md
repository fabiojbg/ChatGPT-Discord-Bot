This is a simple chatGPT bot for Discord

In order to work, you need to clone the repository, open it with visual studio code and do the following:

1) copy the .env_sample file to .env file

2) create a bot in discord and get its access token. This token must be copied to the DISCARD_TOKEN key in the .env file created in the previous step

3) create a OpenAI account and create an ApiKey. 

4) Copy the OpenAI api and OpenAI Organization keys to the OPENAI_KEY and OPENAI_ORGANIZATION keys in the .env file

5) open a Terminal in VS Code and run 'npm install'

6) now run "npm start dev" to start the application

Open discord and to talk to the robot. IMPORTANT: You must start you questions with "Rob," or "Rob:" so the robot can know you are talking to it and not someone else.
